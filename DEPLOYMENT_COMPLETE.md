## üéØ Deployment Instructions

### For New Projects
```bash
# Copy framework to new project root
cp -r AI_DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK/ /path/to/new/project/

# AI agents automatically learn constitutional principles
# Development begins with constitutional compliance active
```

### For Existing Projects
```bash
# Integrate framework without breaking changes
cp -r AI_DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK/ /path/to/existing/project/

# Run validation to assess current state
cd /path/to/existing/project/AI_DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK/
./validate_framework.sh

# Apply constitutional principles incrementally
```

### For Teams & Organizations
```bash
# Central framework repository for organization-wide use
mkdir ~/ai_development_framework/
cp -r AI_DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK/* ~/ai_development_framework/

# Reference framework from all projects
# Consistent constitutional development across entire organization
```

## üß† AI Agent Learning Verification

### Constitutional Principle Internalization ‚úÖ
- **English-only code discipline**: NO Japanese/emoji in variables, functions, comments
- **File size constitutional limits**: 500 lines maximum, split at 400 lines  
- **Single responsibility enforcement**: One clear purpose per component
- **Progressive quality convergence**: Emergency ‚Üí Systematic ‚Üí Production stages
- **Meta-cognitive capability boundaries**: Honest acknowledgment of AI limitations

### Behavioral Programming Requirements ‚úÖ
- **Automatic file size monitoring**: Alert at 400 lines, refuse 500+ lines
- **Cross-reference validation**: Check documentation links before committing
- **Handoff documentation**: Continuous update of continuation guidance
- **Quality gate validation**: Appropriate standards for project stage
- **Collaboration trigger recognition**: Request human help when needed
